# Docker Files

We have prepared a set of docker compose files, allowing you to effortlessly set up and explore UserProfileService in isolated containers. The files include all third-party dependencies and are pre-configured to run seamlessly within the container environment.

Please be aware that the examples provided should not be used in a production environment! They are intended to give you an impression of how the UserProfileService works and should only be utilized in a **development environment** for testing purposes.

The examples can be found [here](https://github.com/bechtleav360/Maverick.UserProfileService/tree/main/examples/).
