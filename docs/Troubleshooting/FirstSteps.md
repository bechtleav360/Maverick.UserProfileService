# First Steps

### Troubleshooting Steps for Service or Saga-Worker

When encountering issues with a service or Saga-Worker, follow these systematic steps to diagnose and resolve the problem effectively:

#### Check Service or Saga-Worker Status

Start by verifying if the Service or Saga-Worker is running as expected. If not, proceed with the following steps:

#### Log and Configuration Examination

1. **Check Logs and Configuration:**
   - Review logs for any errors or anomalies that might indicate why the service is not running.
   - Ensure that the configuration settings are correctly set up and aligned with the service requirements.

#### Logging Level Adjustment

For deeper insights into the issue, consider increasing the log level to Debug or Trace:

2. **Adjust Log Level:**
   - Increase log verbosity to Debug or Trace to gather more detailed information.

#### Credentials Verification

3. **Verify Credentials:**
   - Double-check credentials used by third-party components to prevent authentication issues.
   - Look out for "not authorized - 401" messages in logs as indicators of authentication failures.

#### Health-Endpoints Analysis

4. **Check Health-Endpoints:**
   - Utilize health-endpoints to assess the overall system health.
     - Verify the existence and accessibility of critical components like databases (e.g., ArangDb, Postgres) through state endpoints.
     - Ensure that the correct credentials are used for accessing these components.

#### Log Analysis

5. **Review Logs for Context:**
   - Analyze logs for additional context, errors, or warnings related to the issue.

#### Queue Inspection

6. **Inspect Message Queues:**
   - Check for error messages or stalled processes in message queues, especially in asynchronous communication scenarios.

By following these steps in a methodical manner, you can efficiently troubleshoot and resolve issues affecting your service or Saga-Worker, minimizing downtime and ensuring smooth operation.
